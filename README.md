## About Dreamcloud

***“Everything flows in life as in this site. You will always find new answers”***

The main idea is to create a database in the cloud full of positive and encouraging intentions, dreams, and so on.

As every kid, we believe.
In possibilities, in magic, in smiles.
Later, life goes by.
Observing and learning the rules of the structure. How to process information, how to relate, and also how to think and play. Maybe not a conscious process, but as when we were new to computers, we installed a lot of programs without knowing quite much about them.
That's life.
I think everyone should create their tools to be able to develop themselves. Your way of how you process the info into dreams or goals you aim for. This site is developed with another way of thinking.
Maybe too philosophical. But don't forget most majors developments came from some idea most people couldn't comprehend until it was real.
This is it.
It has more than just to share. It's to create a database in the cloud full of positive and encouraging intentions, dreams, and so on. Like a pyramid in the middle of the desert that reflects into the galaxy.
The cloud.
